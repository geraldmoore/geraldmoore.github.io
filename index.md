## Profile

As a highly analytical, computational, and motivated Data Scientist and Machine Learning Researcher, I have gained valuable knowledge from diverse fields such as Geospatial Remote Sensing, Neurotechnology, Physics, and Astrophysics. I have extensive experience in various areas, including computer vision, image analysis, registration, segmentation, time series analysis, working with large multi-terabyte datasets, Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and statistical data analysis.
\\\\
I am passionate about exploring new ideas and expanding my knowledge in an environment that encourages learning and discovery. I strongly value the entire scope of Data Science, from exploratory data analysis and visualisation to experimentation and scaling pipelines from research to production.
