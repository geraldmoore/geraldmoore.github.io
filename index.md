## Profile

Senior Machine Learning (ML) Engineer with expertise encompassing computer vision, time-series analysis, agentic AI systems, and production ML systems. High impact experience in developing ML solutions for a variety of tasks and scaling from research to production systems. Domain expertise in geospatial remote sensing, neuroscience and astrophysics. Passionate about building innovative solutions and expanding my knowledge in an environment that encourages learning and discovery.

## Experience

_Dec 2022 - present_

**Senior Machine Learning Engineer** \| **_[Agreena, Copenhagen, DK](https://agreena.com/)_**

- Senior technical lead for ML engineering and Data Science, creating and scaling remote sensing models from research to production.
- Led development across several agricultural ML projects: land parcel detection (FracTAL ResUNet), crop sizing and health analysis (Mask R-CNN), and agricultural management detection from time-series (LSTM, Transformers, CatBoost) and images (EfficientNet).
- Solo initiative and development of a geospatial foundation embedding distillation model to optimise and standardise ML pipelines.
- Led, developed, and served, agentic AI ecosystems including user-facing chatbot with custom MCPs and tooling, and a VLM-based (PaliGemma) image report generation system fine-tuned on proprietary data.
- Led and developed large-scale automated data scraping and labelling leveraging Google Street View imagery and finetuned ML models.
- Scaled research projects into production pipelines leveraging Ray, FastAPI, AnyScale and Airflow, driven by KPIs for accuracy, throughput and resource utilisation.
- Assembled Data Science Chapter meetings to align team standards and share domain knowledge across multiple active workstreams.
- Created a Python SDK and data ingestion service for STAC catalogues and API access, driving efficiency across Data and Engineering teams.
- Addressed ground truth data constraints through PCA, manifold learning, K-fold cross-validation, auxillary learning, transfer learning, and ensemble modelling architectures.
- Recognised by CEO and senior leadership for driving value and delivering results with significant contribution to company direction.
- Authored publications, presented at conferences and delivered technical presentations to stakeholders and customer prospects.
- Responsible for hiring and served as go-to-trustee within the team to help address complex challenges.

_Jan 2021 - Dec 2022_

**Data Scientist** \| _**[Hummingbird Technologies, London, UK](https://hummingbirdtech.com/)**_

- Nutured key client partnerships by researching and developing new customer driven solutions, including instance segmentation approach for high resolution object detection in agricultural fields, and an attention based semantic segmentation model for delineating agricultural parcels at scale.
- Led grant-funded research with documentation for research awards and conference presentations.

_Oct 2016 - Jan 2021_

**Ph.D Neurotechnology** \| _**[Imperial College London, London, UK](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/)**_

- Sole ownership and development of an end-to-end analysis pipeline for multi-terabyte image data, including CNN classification through custom or adapted architectures (VGG Net, Google Inception), semantic segmentation (UNet, UNet++), image registration (Elastix, aMAP, ANTs) and dashboard visualisations (Plotly, Dash, Heroku).
- Applied pipeline to investigate neuronal connectivity and structural changes under Alzheimer's and Huntington's pathology.
- Presented research through publications, conferences, and workshops.

## Projects

[**BinOcular**](https://github.com/geraldmoore/binocular)

- Self driven development of a Python package that clusters camera photographs based on feature similarity and temporal thresholding.
- Uses a pre-trained EfficientNet model to compress imagery into a latent feature space, and subsequently uses a cosine-similarity metric and temporal thresholding to group images into _similar_ clusters based on shared features within images.

**Kern**

- A custom personal assistant using the Pydantic AI agentic framework.
- Uses custom function tools to add functionality such as natural-language text to SQL for database querying, English/Italian tutoring, and general purpose AI chatbot.
