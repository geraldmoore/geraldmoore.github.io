## Profile

As a highly analytical, computational, and motivated Data Scientist and Machine Learning Researcher, I have gained valuable knowledge from diverse fields such as Geospatial Remote Sensing, Neurotechnology, Physics, and Astrophysics. I have extensive experience in various areas, including computer vision, image analysis, registration, segmentation, time series analysis, working with large multi-terabyte datasets, Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and statistical data analysis.

I am passionate about exploring new ideas and expanding my knowledge in an environment that encourages learning and discovery. I strongly value the entire scope of Data Science, from exploratory data analysis and visualisation to experimentation and scaling pipelines from research to production.

## Experience

_Dec 2022 - present_

**Senior Machine Learning Scientist** \| **_[Agreena, London, UK (formerly Hummingbird Technologies, London, UK)](https://agreena.com/)_**

Encompassing data science, ML engineering and software engineering in the remote sensing and verification field, using satellite and drone imagery inputs. Remote detection of agricultural land (FracTAL ResUNet) and crops (Mask R-CNN), time series classification and prediction with custom or adapted architectures (1D CNN, LSTM, CatBoost, XGBoost, Transformers) and scene classification through transfer learning or custom architectures (2D CNN, MobileNet, EfficientNet). Scaling analysis pipelines from research and development stage, to deployment in production environments. Individually responsible for developing a Python wrapper software developer kit to standardise and improve efficiency in data management with STAC. Formulating unit, integration and end-to-end testing of production code-bases.

_Jan 2021 - Dec 2022_

**Data Scientist** \| _**[Hummingbird Technologies, London, UK](https://hummingbirdtech.com/)**_

Nurturing key client partnerships by researching and developing new customer driven DL solutions, such as an instance segmentation approach for high resolution object detection in agricultural fields, and an attention based semantic segmentation model for delineating agricultural parcels at large scale. Technical interviewing for new candidates, conducting grant funded research and creating comprehensive documentation for research award programs and conference presentations.

_Oct 2016 - Jan 2021_

**Ph.D Neurotechnology** \| _**[Imperial College London, London, UK](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/)**_

Sole ownership of developing an end-to-end analysis pipeline of multi-terabyte image data, including CNN classification through custom or adapted architectures (VGG Net, Google Inception), semantic segmentation (UNet, UNet++), image registration (Elastix, aMAP, ANTs) and dashboard visualisations (Ploty, Dash, Heroki). Applied the pipeline to investigate neuronal connectivity in the visual thalamic and pre-frontal cortex pathways, as well as studying structural changes under Alzheimer's and Huntington's pathology. Research was presented through publications, conferences, and workshops.
