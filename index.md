## Profile

As a highly analytical, computational, and motivated Data Scientist (DS) and Machine Learning (ML) Researcher, I have gained valuable knowledge from diverse fields such as Geospatial Remote Sensing, Neurotechnology, Physics, and Astrophysics. I have extensive experience in areas including computer vision, registration, segmentation, time-series analysis, agentic AI, working with large multi-terabyte datasets, statistical data analysis and pipeline-scaling from research to production environments.

I am passionate about exploring innovative ideas and expanding my knowledge in an environment that encourages learning and discovery. I am looking for an opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge to solve complex problems and contribute to the development of cutting-edge and impactful technologies.

## Projects

[**BinOcular**](https://github.com/geraldmoore/binocular)

- Self driven development of a Python package that clusters camera photographs based on feature similarity and temporal thresholding.
- Uses a pre-trained efficientnet model to compress imagery into a latent feature space, and subsequently uses a cosine-similarity metric and temporal thresholding to group images into _similar_ clusters based on shared features within images.

[**Kern**]

- A custom personal assitant using the Pydantic AI agentic framework. 
- Uses custom function tools to add functionality such as natural-language text to SQL for database querying, English/Italian tutoring, and general purpose AI chatbot.
